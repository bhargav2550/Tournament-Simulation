# Tournament-Simulation
I have created different classes which are Player,teams,field,umpire,commentator etc.,<br>
we can create a team of 11 players and 2 teams, after this we can start a match then it will randomly generate scores and if out ot not out.<br>
After completing 2 innings it will declare which team has won the match.<br>
I have created 11 Current Indian Players and created two teams with the same players.<br>
You can create another 11 players for team 2.<br>
